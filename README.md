# GettingAndCleaningDataProject
Project for Getting and Cleaning Class


This is the required project for the John Hopkins/Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

It contains
    R executable - runAnalysis.R
    Codebook that explains the data
    This readme file
    A tidy dataset

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the students ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Required submission:
  1) a tidy data set as described below 
  2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
  3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data           called CodeBook.md.  

 A full  description of the data used is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The data was obtained here

 R script called run_analysis.R  does the following. 
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
